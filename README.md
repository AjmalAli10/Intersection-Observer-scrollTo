## Demo

You can see a live application demo [here](https://stackblitz-starters-xkvys9.stackblitz.io).

## Usage

You can also try out this React application on StackBlitz, an online development environment for web applications. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Open Project in StackBlitz**: Click on the following link to open the project in StackBlitz: [Open in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-xkvys9?file=README.md)

2. **Preview the Application**: Once the StackBlitz project has loaded, you will see a live preview of the React application. The "Hello LinkedIn!" heading will be visible along with the scrollable content.

3. **Interact with the Scroll Button**: As you scroll down the page, the "Scroll Me Top" button will become visible on the right side. This button allows you to smoothly scroll back to the top of the page. It appears when the "Hello LinkedIn!" heading is no longer visible in the viewport.

4. **Explore and Modify**: Feel free to explore the codebase, make changes to the styles in `style.css`, and experiment with the smooth scrolling behavior. StackBlitz allows you to make changes and see the results in real time.
